# Submission Spreadsheet

This folder is a place to store:

- **Submission Spreadsheet:** A template excel file that can be used by data submitters and data stewards to make a new submission to GHGA Archive.
- **Mapping JSON:** A mapping JSON that maps fields in the submission spreadsheet to fields in the metadata schema. This is required for when you are trying to translate a submission spreadsheet to a GHGA Metadata Schema compatible JSON.
