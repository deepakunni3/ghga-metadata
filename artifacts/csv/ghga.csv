agent,,"An agent is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity. Agents include a Person, Organization, or Software that performs an activity."
aggregate_dataset,,An Aggregate Dataset is a specialized dataset that is built by combining one or more Datasets together.
analysis,,An Analysis is a data transformation that transforms input data to output data. The workflow used to achieve this transformation and the individual steps are also captured.
analysis_dataset,,An Analysis Dataset is a collection of Files generated from one or more Analysis performed on data from one or more Studies.
analysis_process,,"An analysis process is a process that describes how one or more Files, from a Study, are transformed to another set of Files via a Workflow. The analysis process also keeps track of the workflow metadata and the Agent that is running the Analysis."
anatomical_entity,,Biological entity that is either an individual member of a biological species or constitutes the structural organization of an individual member of a biological species.
attribute,,A key/value pair that further characterizes an entity.
biological_quality,,A biological quality is a quality held by a biological entity.
biospecimen,,"A Biospecimen is any natural material taken from a biological entity (usually a human) for testing, diagnostics, treatment, or research purposes. The Biospecimen is linked to the Individual from which the Biospecimen is derived."
cell_line,,A cultured cell population that represents a genetically stable and homogenous population of cultured cells that shares a common propagation history.
cohort,,A cohort is a collection of individuals that share a common characteristic/observation and have been grouped together for a research study/investigation.
committee,,A group of people organized for a specific purpose.
data_access_committee,,"A group of members that are delegated to grant access to one or more datasets after ensuring the minimum criteria for data sharing has been met, and request for data use does not raise ethical and/or legal concerns."
data_access_policy,,"A Data Access Policy specifies under which circumstances, legal or otherwise, a user can have access to one or more Datasets belonging to one or more Studies."
data_transformation,,A data transformation technique used to analyze and interpret data to gain a better understanding of it.
data_use_condition,,Data Use Condition represents the use conditions associated with a Dataset. A permission field can have one or more terms that collectively defines the data use condition. The modifier determines the interpretation of the use permission(s).
dataset,,A Dataset is a collection of Files that is prepared for distribution.
disease,,A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism.
disease_or_phenotypic_feature,,Disease or Phenotypic Feature that the entity is associated with. This entity is a union of Disease and Phenotypic Feature and exists to accommodate situations where Disease concepts are used interchangeably with Phenotype concepts or vice-versa.
donor,,A Donor is an Individual that participates in a research Study by donating a Biospecimen. The use of the Biospecimen is restricted to the consent provided by the Donor.
experiment,,"An experiment is an investigation that consists of a coordinated set of actions and observations designed to generate data with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis."
experiment_dataset,,An Experiment Dataset is a collection of Files linked to one or more Experiments from one or more Studies.
experiment_process,,An Experiment Process is a process that describes how a Sample is transformed to a File via an assay. The Experiment Process also keeps track of the Protocol used and the Agent that is running the experiment.
family,,"A domestic group, or a number of domestic groups linked through descent (demonstrated or stipulated) from a common ancestor, marriage, or adoption."
file,,
individual,,An Individual is a Person who is participating in a Study.
information_content_entity,,A generically dependent continuant that is about some thing.
investigation,,Investigation is the process of carrying out a plan or procedure so as to discover fact or information about the object of study.
library_preparation_protocol,,Information about the library preparation of an Experiment.
material_entity,,"A material entity is a physical entity that is spatially extended, exists as a whole at any point in time and has mass."
member,,Member of an Organization or a Committee.
named_thing,,"A databased entity, concept or class. This is a generic class that is the root of all the other classes."
person,,A member of the species Homo sapiens.
phenotypic_feature,,"The observable form taken by some character (or group of characters) in an individual or an organism, excluding pathology and disease. The detectable outward manifestations of a specific genotype."
planned_process,,"A process is an entity that exists in time by occurring or happening, has temporal parts and always involves and depends on some entity during the time it occurs."
population,,"A population is a collection of individuals from the same taxonomic class living, counted or sampled at a particular site or in a particular area."
project,,Any specifically defined piece of work that is undertaken or attempted to meet a single requirement.
protocol,,"A plan specification which has sufficient level of detail and quantitative information to communicate it between investigation agents, so that different investigation agents will reliably be able to independently reproduce the process."
publication,,"The Publication entity represents a publication. While a publication can be any article that is published, the minimum expectation is that the publication has a valid DOI."
research_activity,,A planned process executed in the performance of scientific research wherein systematic investigations are performed to establish facts and reach new conclusions about phenomena in the world.
sample,,"A sample is a limited quantity of something to be used for testing, analysis, inspection, investigation, demonstration, or trial use. A sample is prepared from a Biospecimen (isolate or tissue)."
sequencing_protocol,,Information about the sequencing of a sample.
study,,Studies are experimental investigations of a particular phenomenon. It involves a detailed examination and analysis of a subject to learn more about the phenomenon being studied.
technology,,A Technology is an abstraction that represents the instrument used for an assay. The Technology entity captures instrument-specific attributes that are relevant for an Experiment entity. The Technology entity may be further characterized by its children where each child has fields that are relevant to that particular technology.
user,,A user in GHGA.
workflow,,A Workflow is an abstraction that represents the workflow used to perform an analysis. The Workflow entity captures workflow-specific attributes that are relevant for an Analysis entity. The Workflow entity may be further characterized by its children where each child has fields that are relevant to that particular workflow.
workflow_parameter,,A key/value pair that represents a parameter used in a Workflow Step.
workflow_step,,"A Workflow Step represents each individual step performed in a Workflow. If the Workflow is a single-step workflow then the Workflow has just one Workflow Step entity. If the Workflow is a multi-step workflow then the Workflow has a Workflow Step entity for each step. All Workflow step specific attributes like parameters, and metadata about execution environment are captured by the Workflow Step entity."
