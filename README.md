# GHGA Metadata Schema

The [German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA)](https://www.ghga.de/) is
funded by the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/en/)
within the framework of the
[National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/en-gb).

The main goal of GHGA is to address the needs for establishing a national
genome archive for human genome data while tackling challenges in data
access, sharing, and privacy. GHGA aims to provide a national infrastructure
for secure and safe storage,access management, dissemination, and analysis of
human omics data under a coherent ethical-legal framework. 

This repository aims to serve as the source of truth for the metadata schema
used by the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive.

The schema is modeled using SchemaPack and exists as a YAML, which can be
found in `build`.
