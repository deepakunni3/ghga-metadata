  checksum:
    description: >-
      A computed value which depends on the contents of a block of data and which is transmitted or
      stored along with the data in order to detect corruption of the data.
      The receiving system recomputes the checksum based upon the received data and compares this
      value with the one sent with the data. If the two values are the same, the receiver has some confidence
      that the data was received correctly.
