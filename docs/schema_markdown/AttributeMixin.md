## Mixin for

 * [Condition](Condition.md) (mixin)  - The Condition specifies which special characteristics and treatments apply to a Sample. It is used to link comparable Samples.
 * [LibraryPreparationProtocol](LibraryPreparationProtocol.md) (mixin)  - The Library Preparation Protocol captures information about the Library Preparation of an Sequencing Experiment.
 * [Sample](Sample.md) (mixin)  - A sample is a limited quantity of something to be used for testing, analysis, inspection, investigation, demonstration, or trial use. A sample is prepared from a Biospecimen (isolate or tissue).
 * [SequencingExperiment](SequencingExperiment.md) (mixin)  - An sequencing experiment is an investigation that consists of a coordinated set of actions and observations designed to generate data with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis.
 * [SequencingProcess](SequencingProcess.md) (mixin)  - The Sequencing Process captures the technical parameters that were used to produce sequencing output from a Sample. It links a Sample to sequencing output.
 * [SequencingProtocol](SequencingProtocol.md) (mixin)  - The Sequencing Protocol captures information about parameters and metadata associated with a Sequencing Experiment.
 * [Study](Study.md) (mixin)  - A Study is an experimental investigation of a particular phenomenon. It involves a detailed examination and analysis of a subject to learn more about the phenomenon being studied.
