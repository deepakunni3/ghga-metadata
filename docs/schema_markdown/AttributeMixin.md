## Mixin for

 * [Condition](Condition.md) (mixin)  - An condition that is linked to comparable samples.
 * [LibraryPreparationProtocol](LibraryPreparationProtocol.md) (mixin)  - Information about the library_preparation of an sequencing experiment.
 * [Sample](Sample.md) (mixin)  - A sample is a limited quantity of something to be used for testing, analysis, inspection, investigation, demonstration, or trial use. A sample is prepared from a Biospecimen (isolate or tissue).
 * [SequencingExperiment](SequencingExperiment.md) (mixin)  - An sequencing experiment is an investigation that consists of a coordinated set of actions and observations designed to generate data with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis.
 * [SequencingProcess](SequencingProcess.md) (mixin)  - A sequencing process linking a sample to sequencing output.
 * [SequencingProtocol](SequencingProtocol.md) (mixin)  - Information about the sequencing of a sample.
 * [Study](Study.md) (mixin)  - Studies are experimental investigations of a particular phenomenon. It involves a detailed examination and analysis of a subject to learn more about the phenomenon being studied.
