Type of flow cell used (e.g. S4, S2 for NovaSeq; PromethION, Flongle for Nanopore). Aparatus in the fluidic subsystem where the sheath and sample meet. Can be one of several types; jet-in-air, quartz cuvette, or a hybrid of the two. The sample flows through the center of a fluid column of sheath fluid in the flow cell.
