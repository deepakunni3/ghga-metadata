 * [biospecimen_isolation](biospecimen_isolation.md) - Method or device employed for collecting/isolating a Biospecimen or a Sample.
 * [biospecimen_tissue_term](biospecimen_tissue_term.md) - The tissue this Biospecimen originated from. Should be a term from the BRENDA Tissue Ontology vocabulary (e.g., kidney, blood, melanoma cell).
 * [diagnosis_ids](diagnosis_ids.md) - One or more diagnoses that the entity is associated with at the time of retrieval from the organism.

 * [phenotypic_features_ids](phenotypic_features_ids.md) - The corresponding ID to the HPO vocabulary (e.g., HP:0002732, HP:0012735, HP:0002615).
 * [phenotypic_features_terms](phenotypic_features_terms.md) - The phenotypic feature concepts that the entity is associated with at the time of retrieval from the organism.
