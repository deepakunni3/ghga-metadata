 * [Sample➞biospecimen_tissue_id](Sample_biospecimen_tissue_id.md)
 * [Sample➞biospecimen_tissue_term](Sample_biospecimen_tissue_term.md)
 * [ancestry_ids](ancestry_ids.md) - The corresponding ID to the HANCESTRO vocabulary (e.g., HANCESTRO:0010, HANCESTRO:0005, HANCESTRO:0017).
 * [ancestry_terms](ancestry_terms.md) - A person's descent or lineage from a population. The Ancestry is captured using a concept from the Human Ancestry Ontology "ancestry category" (HANCESTRO:0004) branch (e.g., African, European, Oceanian).
 * [biospecimen_tissue_id](biospecimen_tissue_id.md) - The corresponding ontology ID for the biospecimen_tissue_term (e.g., BTO:0000671, BTO:0000089, BTO:0000848).
 * [biospecimen_tissue_term](biospecimen_tissue_term.md) - The tissue this Biospecimen originated from. Should be a term from the BRENDA Tissue Ontology vocabulary (e.g., kidney, blood, melanoma cell).
 * [diagnosis_ids](diagnosis_ids.md) - One or more diagnoses that the entity is associated with at the time of retrieval from the organism. The diagnosis is captured using a code from ICD-10 (WHO version). Please restrict the ICD code to the chapter letter and two digits for the main diagnosis (e.g., E10, C01).
 * [diagnosis_terms](diagnosis_terms.md) - The ICD-10 terms corresponding to the ICD-10 codes (e.g., Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Malignant neoplasm of base of tongue).
 * [geographical_region_id](geographical_region_id.md) - The corresponding ID to the NCIT vocabulary (e.g., NCIT:C16312, NCIT:C16636, NCIT:C16761).
 * [geographical_region_term](geographical_region_term.md) - The geographical region where the Individual is located. The Geographical Region is captured using a concept from the NCIT "country" class (NCIT:C25464) (e.g., Austria, Germany, Italy).
 * [phenotypic_features_ids](phenotypic_features_ids.md) - The corresponding ID to the HPO vocabulary (e.g., HP:0002732, HP:0012735, HP:0002615).
 * [phenotypic_features_terms](phenotypic_features_terms.md) - The phenotypic feature concepts that the entity is associated with at the time of retrieval from the organism. The Phenotypic Feature is captured using a concept from the Human Phenotype Ontology (e.g., Lymph node hypoplasia, Cough, Hypotension).
