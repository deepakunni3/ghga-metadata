### Slots

 * [Biospecimen➞isolation](Biospecimen_isolation.md) - Method or device employed for collecting/isolating the Sample.
 * [Biospecimen➞tissue](Biospecimen_tissue.md) - The tissue this Biospecimen originated from.
 * [Individual➞ancestries](Individual_ancestries.md)
 * [Individual➞geographical_region](Individual_geographical_region.md)
 * [Individual➞phenotypic_features](Individual_phenotypic_features.md)
 * [Sample➞isolation](Sample_isolation.md) - Method or device employed for collecting/isolating the Sample.
 * [Sample➞type](Sample_type.md) - The type of the Sample.
 * [ancestries](ancestries.md) - A person's descent or lineage, from a person or from a population.
 * [geographical_region](geographical_region.md) - The geographical region where the Individual is located. Any demarcated area of the Earth; may be determined by both natural and human boundaries.
 * [isolation](isolation.md) - Method or device employed for collecting/isolating a biospecimen or a sample.
 * [phenotypic_features](phenotypic_features.md) - The phenotypic feature concepts that the entity is associated with at the time of retrieval from the organism. Typically, the phenotypic feature is captured using a concept from Human Phenotype Ontology. E.g., 'HP:0100244' indicates that the Individual the Biospecimen was extracted from exhibits 'Fibrosarcoma' as one of its phenotype.
 * [tissue](tissue.md)
