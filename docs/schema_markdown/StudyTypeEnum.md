## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| FLUXOMICS | Experimental approaches to determine the rates of metabolic reactions - the metabolic fluxes - within a biological entity. The "fluxome" is the complete set of metabolic fluxes in a cell, and is a dynamic aspect of phenotype. | topic:3955 |  |
| GENOMICS | Whole genomes of one or more organisms, or genomes in general, such as meta-information on genomes, genome projects, gene names. | topic:0622 |  |
| COMPARATIVE_GENOMICS | The study (typically comparison) of the sequence, structure or function of multiple genomes. | topic:0797 |  |
| EPIGENOMICS | The study of the epigenetic modifications of a whole cell, tissue, organism. Epigenetics concerns the heritable changes in gene expression owing to mechanisms other than DNA sequence variation. | topic:3173 |  |
| EPISTASIS | The study of the epigenetic modifications of a whole cell, tissue, organism. The study of the phenomena whereby the effects of one locus mask the allelic effects of another, such as how dominant alleles mask the effects of the recessive alleles at the same locus. | topic:3974 |  |
| FUNCTIONAL_GENOMICS | The study of gene or protein functions and their interactions in totality in a given organism, tissue, cell. | topic:0085 |  |
| METAGENOMICS | The study of genetic material recovered from environmental samples, and associated environmental data. | topic:3174 |  |
| PALEOGENOMICS | The reconstruction and analysis of genomic information in extinct species. | topic:3943 |  |
| PHARMACOGENOMICS | The influence of genotype on drug response, for example by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with drug efficacy or toxicity. | topic:0208 |  |
| PHYLOGENOMICS | The integrated study of evolutionary relationships and whole genome data, for example, in the analysis of species trees, horizontal gene transfer and evolutionary reconstruction. | topic:0194 |  |
| POPULATION_GENOMICS | Large-scale study (typically comparison) of DNA sequences of populations. | topic:3796 |  |
| PROTEOGENOMICS | A field of biological research focused on the discovery and identification of peptides, typically by comparing mass spectra against a protein database. | topic:3922 |  |
| STRUCTURAL_GENOMICS | The elucidation of the three dimensional structure for all (available) proteins in a given organism. | topic:0122 |  |
| TRANSCRIPTOMICS | The analysis of transcriptomes, or a set of all the RNA molecules in a specific cell, tissue. | topic:3308 |  |
| METATRANSCRIPTOMICS | The study of microbe gene expression within natural environments (i.e. the metatranscriptome). Metatranscriptomics methods can be used for whole gene expression profiling of complex microbial communities. | topic:3941 |  |
| IMMUNOMICS | The study of immune system as a whole, its regulation and response to pathogens using genome-wide approaches. | topic:3967 |  |
| METABOLOMICS | The systematic study of metabolites, the chemical processes they are involved, and the chemical fingerprints of specific cellular processes in a whole cell, tissue, organ or organism. | topic:3172 |  |
| MOLECULAR_EVOLUTION | The study of the process and mechanism of change of biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins across generations. | topic:3945 |  |
| PHENOMICS | Phenomes, or the study of the change in phenotype (the physical and biochemical traits of organisms) in response to genetic and environmental factors. | topic:3298 |  |
| PROTEOMICS | Protein and peptide identification, especially in the study of whole proteomes of organisms. Includes metaproteomics: proteomics analysis of an environmental sample.  Proteomics includes any methods (especially high-throughput) that separate, characterize and identify expressed proteins such as mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein microarrays, as well as in-silico methods that perform proteolytic or mass calculations on a protein sequence and other analyses of protein production data, for example in different cells or tissues. | topic:0121 |  |
| OTHER | A study type not captured by the above mentioned. |  |  |
